# MultiPerson Tracking and Path Overlay

This project is an end-term assignment for a Computer Vision course. It focuses on **tracking multiple people** in a custom one-minute video, **drawing real-time path overlays** using distinct colors for each individual, even when paths intersect or identities switch.

## Project Description

- Tracks at least **3 individuals** walking and crossing paths.
- ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ Draws each personâ€™s walking path with a **distinct colored line** (e.g., Red, Green, Blue).
- Maintains **identity consistency**, even during overlaps.
- Outputs an annotated video preserving the original scene and overlaying the visual paths.

## Features

- Real-time object tracking using YOLO-based detectors.
- Identity association for multiple targets (e.g., SORT/DeepSORT).
- Trajectory visualization.
- Exported annotated video.
